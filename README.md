# demoModule
A simple demo how to implement your algorithm compatible to our plattform
## Installation
Run ```npm install``` to get dependencies installed prior to build/run/develop anything in this project.

## Debugging
Use ```npx devserver``` to serve the compiled files at localhost.

## Compiler output
For integration in our platform it is required to have three output files.
- ```index.js```
- ```README.md```
- ```parameters.json```

### index.js
This file will contain your algorithm after it got compiled by the typescript compiler to improve overall compatibility and prevent type errors.
### parameters.json
This file should contain a definition of the required parameters to run your algorithm. These parameters will be entered by a user and should not replace internal constants!
### README.md
This file is for describing your algorithm. Use it to explain users how your algorithm works and what it's advantages and disadvantages are.

## Platform integration
To get your algorithm listed, you need to contact [insert email here] for validation.
This is required to ensure good quality content and to prevent quality issues.
